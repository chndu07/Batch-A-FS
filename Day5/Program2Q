Mr. Bob is a Military Encoders. 
Mr. Bob writes a word as shown below and then merges them. 
Help Bob to write the code. 

Mr. Bob will be given a word 'w' and a number 'n' 

Sample Test Case - 1
input = 
ABCDE
2
output = ACEBD


This is How Bob writes the letters of the word 
A    C    E
   B    D

Now concatenate the two rows and ignore spaces in every row. We get ACEBD


Sample Test Case - 2
input = system
3
output = seytms


s         e
  y    t    m
     s

Now concatenate the 3 rows we get seytms

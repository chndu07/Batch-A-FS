Write a java program to read a word as input and returns another string as output, 
such that , a vowel in the input string will be de denoted by upper case letter ‘V’ and a 
consonant in the input string will be denoted by upper case letter ‘C’. 

Note - The output will contain a word containing alternating sequence of ‘C’ and ‘V’.
It is not permissible to have two or more consecutive V or C in Sequence.
Assume the Input String will contain only lower and upper case alphabets 

input = hello 
output = CVCV

Explanation - When we convert the above  "hello" we have CVCCV 
but for the output It is not permissible to have two or more consecutive V or C in Sequence.
so CVCCV changes to CVCV 


Sample Test Cases 

input = aeibo
output = VCV

input = Whereabouts
output = CVCVCVC
             
input = aeiou
output = V

input = BCDEFGIIKL
output = CVCVC

input = aeiOUabCdEfg
output = VCVC
